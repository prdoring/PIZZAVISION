| Path                   | Purpose                                                         |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |

## Admin Interface

The **Admin** page ( `/pizzavision/admin` ) lets the host manage the night without digging into the database:

| Control             | What it does                                                                                 |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------                 |
| **Reorder**         | Drag entries to change the running order (updates immediately for everyone).                 |
| **Remove**          | Remove a song, currently all entries are in the list, you may want to prune after semis.     |
| **Delete Vote**     | Clear all votes and users from the DB (useful after testing)                                 |
| **Restore / Reset** | Bring back all songs from the original list                                                  |

> **Heads‚Äëup:** After heavy admin changes some browsers may cache stale data. If a guest‚Äôs screen acts weird, ask them to *hard‚Äërefresh* or clear site data.
